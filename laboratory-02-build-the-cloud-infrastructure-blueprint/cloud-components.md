# Cloud Infrastructure Components (Variant 2: Table Format)

| Component | Purpose | Why It Matters in Cloud Computing | Relation to KillerCoda Environment |
|---|---|---|---|
| *Compute* | Provides the CPU and memory that run applications and processes. | Lets providers scale processing power up/down on demand instead of buying fixed hardware. | The container's CPU cores (lscpu`/nproc`) and RAM (free -h) are its allocated compute resource. |
| *Storage* | Holds data persistently — OS files, logs, application data. | Cloud storage is durable and scalable, and decoupled from any single compute instance. | The root filesystem and mounted volumes shown by df -h`/mount` are the container's storage. |
| *Networking* | Connects instances to each other and the internet via IPs, routing, and firewall rules. | Determines what's reachable and secure — central to any cloud deployment. | The hostname and IP (hostname, ip addr) show how the container is addressed on its network. |
| *Operating System* | Manages hardware resources and provides the runtime for applications. | Affects compatibility, patching, and available tooling; providers offer many OS images to choose from. | The Linux distro/kernel (os-release, uname -r) running the playground is the base image, just like a cloud VM image. |
