# AWS Research

## Brief Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cloud computing platform operated by Amazon, launched in 2006. It was the first major public cloud provider and remains the market leader, offering the broadest catalog of cloud services of any provider — over 200 fully featured services covering compute, storage, databases, networking, machine learning, analytics, and more.

## Global Infrastructure

AWS organizes its infrastructure into *Regions* (geographic areas) and *Availability Zones* (isolated data centers within a region). As of 2026, AWS operates roughly 30+ regions and 100+ Availability Zones worldwide, with a presence on every continent except Antarctica. Each region typically has at least three Availability Zones to support high availability and fault tolerance.

## Cloud Management Console

The *AWS Management Console* is the web-based interface for provisioning, configuring, and monitoring AWS resources. It also offers the AWS CLI (command line interface) and SDKs for programmatic access, plus AWS CloudShell for browser-based command-line management without local setup.

## Four Core Services

1. *Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)* — resizable virtual machine instances for running applications.
2. *Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)* — durable, scalable object storage for any amount of data.
3. *Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)* — isolated virtual networking for AWS resources.
4. *AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)* — fine-grained control over who can access which AWS resources.

## Three Advantages

1. *Largest service catalog* — AWS has the widest range of specialized services, so most cloud architecture patterns already have a mature, well-documented AWS implementation.
2. *Market maturity and ecosystem* — being the oldest major provider, it has the largest community, most third-party tooling, and deepest hiring pool of AWS-certified engineers.
3. *Global scale and reliability* — extensive region/AZ coverage supports high-availability architectures with low latency for a global user base.

## Typical Enterprise Use Cases

- Hosting large-scale, high-traffic web applications and e-commerce platforms
- Big data analytics and data lakes (using services like Amazon Redshift and Athena)
- Enterprises needing a very wide range of specialized managed services rather than building custom solutions
- Media streaming and content delivery (via Amazon CloudFront)
